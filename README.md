# leaflet-challenge

Used the quckstart guide from https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/ to get where I was.  

Create a new repository for this project called leaflet-challenge. This project focuses on building tools for the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to visualize earthquake data more effectively. USGS collects vast amounts of data daily, and this challenge aims to create a meaningful display of that information.

Getting Started

Create the leaflet-challenge repository and clone it to your computer. Inside your local Git repository, create directories for each part of the challenge: Leaflet-Part-1 and Leaflet-Part-2. These directories will hold all necessary HTML and JavaScript files for the analysis. Make sure to push these changes to GitHub.

Files

Download the Module 15 Challenge files to start with the project. These files contain essential resources needed for the challenge.

Instructions

Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization

Your task is to visualize an earthquake dataset:

Select a dataset from the USGS GeoJSON Feed page for visualization.
Use Leaflet to create a map that plots earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude. Data markers should reflect the earthquake's magnitude (size) and depth (color).
Include popups for more information about the earthquake and a legend for map data context.

Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data (Optional)

Optionally, add a dataset showing tectonic plates to explore the relationship between tectonic movements and seismic activity. Enhance your map with additional base maps, separate overlays for earthquakes and tectonic plates, and layer controls for user interaction.

Submission Details

Your submission should include interactive maps with earthquake visualizations and, optionally, tectonic plates data. Ensure your maps have functionalities for popups, legends, and layer controls. Organize all project files correctly in the leaflet-challenge repository and push them to GitHub.

Conclusion

This README guides the leaflet-challenge project, focusing on the visualization of USGS earthquake data. Completing this challenge will result in tools that enhance the understanding of seismic activities, aiding USGS in educating the public and securing funding for further research.
